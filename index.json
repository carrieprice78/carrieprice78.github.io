Instead of entering Boolean strings into one-dimensional search boxes, queries are formulated by combining objects on a two-dimensional canvas. This eliminates syntax errors, makes the query semantics more transparent, and offers a more effective way to optimize, save and share search strategies.  BioReader: BioReader can help you distill your reading list by ranking articles by relevance. Simply collect the PubMed IDs of a number of articles you found relevant and a similar number of articles not relevant to you. BioReader will provide you with a ranked reading list to limit the time wasted on reading irrelevant literature.  Medrxivr: Medxrivr allows you to perform advanced search and batch export in Medrxiv. Documentation available at Github.  Publibee: Publibee is a platform developed by Stanford University individuals that uses PubMed data and maintains Legacy PubMed functionality.  PubReMiner: PubReMiner will query PubMed with your specified search query, get all abstracts and generate frequency tables.  PubVenn: PubVenn enables you to explore PubMed using venn diagrams.  Search Translating Tools   MEDLINE Transpose: MEDLINE Transpose was developed to mitigate a common problem among information specialists: converting search syntax between PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE interfaces.  Polyglot Search via SR Accelerator: The IEBH SR-Accelerator is a suite of tools to speed up steps in the Systematic Review (SR) process. It is freely available for anyone in the world to use. Simply register below with your name and email address. The SRA is a modular design which means the tools can be incorporated into existing SR workflows and combined with other automation tools.

Information Dissemination and Networking Shape your professional profile using platforms like Twitter ( Azu, et al., 2012) and bring awareness to your field of research. Anyone searching the internet might find you!\n Choose a hashtag or hashtags that you can use when you Tweet about research of interest. Using the hashtags will help make the tweets discoverable. Have your research team create Twitter profiles to tweet their and others\u0026rsquo; research. Keep a departmental list of Twitter users so that you can easily tag each other. Consider holding a Twitter-based Journal Club or Virtual Chat.  Live Tweeting the Meeting Live-tweeting events and conferences can allow for engagement beyond the attendees and enable a thoughtful conversation to continue past the event ( Barnes, et al., 2018).\n Choose a hashtag for the event and tell participants about it in registration materials, on the website, and at the event. Mark all tweets about the event with the chosen hashtag. Ask the conference team to create or share their Twitter handles. Tag them in the Tweets when appropriate (on authored papers, on events where they are presenting, etc.). Put together a master list of event-related Twitter users for the event that participants can follow and tag.  Getting Started  Download the Twitter app to your smartphone or use the Twitter website or both. Register for an account. Add a professional photo and write a brief bio about your areas of interest. You can use hashtags in your bio to be more easily discoverable. Follow users and accounts in your areas of interest. Check your Twitter feed once or twice a day to like and retweet content of interest, or respond to others\u0026rsquo; tweets to start a respectful discussion. When you feel comfortable, you can begin tweeting on your own.  Becoming a Twitter Pro  Keep a separate professional account and refrain from engaging in sensitive topics, like politics, from your professional account. Use a professional photo so that you are recognizable to your peers. Retain personal boundaries and be mindful of giving out too much identifying information since all the information is public. Don\u0026rsquo;t tweet anything you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say out loud in public. Photos, GIFs, graphics, and links receive more engagements than just text. You can incorporate polls into your tweets to get feedback from key stakeholder groups.  Ethics in the Twitterverse  DO ask permission to share photos of colleagues and peers before posting DO cite your sources DO stick to professional and collegial discourse DON\u0026rsquo;T share patient information or photographs without explicit consent DON\u0026rsquo;T diagnose or give medical medical advice DON\u0026rsquo;T share speaker slides if they ask you not to DON\u0026rsquo;T share unpublished data   Reference: Barnes, S.

Identify a question framework to use to acheive clarity in the research question. Solicit input from collaborators, peers, and mentors. If you can, consult with a librarian or information professional to assist you with a thorough search.

The JHNEBP Model\u0026rsquo;s Appendix A - PET Management Guide, supplies you with a checklist to ensure that you have thought through all the steps and have a winning team in place prior to the start. PET stands for Practice Question, Evidence, Translation.\nWhen framing the EBP question, consider ideas such as:\n What is the problem, and why is it important to fix it? What is the current practice? What kinds of evidence or study types will help answer the question?  Is your question a background question or a foreground question?\nBackground Questions - These are usually broad and used in the beginning. Background questions can be refined and adjusted as continue to develop the search. Background questions frequently assist in identifying best practices.\nForeground Questions - These types of questions are focused, with specific comparisons of ideas or interventions. Foreground questions can provide specific evidence related to the research question. Background questions can turn into foreground questions as the review progresses.\nThis process can be identified in the JHNEBP Model, Appendix B - Question Development Tool PICO. After you\u0026rsquo;ve completed Appendix A and Appendix B, complete Appendix C - Stakeholder Analysis Tool. This form is used to identify key stakeholders that can support decision-making, serve as subject matter experts, or implement change.\nSearching for Evidence To find the evidence, you will need to search for it. It will depend on what resources you have access to through your institution, but it is always a best practice to search more than one resource. This is because different resources index different topics and journals.\nUse your question framework or JHNEBP Question Development Tool to determine the major elements of your question. Think about how authors might write about these concepts. There may be many terms to describe just one idea.\nUse the Searching for Evidence with ABCDE or another search approach to conduct a thorough, effective, and comprehensive literature search, and be sure to work with a librarian if you can.\nTranslation Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to critically appraise and take action on the evidence you found through the search. The JHNEBP Model has several tools available to help you grade the evidence and see the process through to the finish line.\n Appendix D - The Evidence Level and Guide outlines three levels of evidence with quality ratings and describes each in a rubric. Appendix E - The Research Evidence Appraisal Tool helps you decide if the evidence is quantitative or qualitative, and how to use that evidence to support your topic. Appendix F - Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll find literature that is not primary research. Appendix F walks you through the steps of grading non-research evidence with the Non-Research Evidence Appraisal Tool. Appendix G - You\u0026rsquo;ve read the research and appraised the evidence. Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to put it all together with the Individual Evidence Summary Tool. Appendix H - The Synthesis Process and Recommendations Tool helps you make sense of the strength of the evidence toward a particular recommendation. Appendix I - The Action Planning Tool ensures that you have a team in place to help you champion and implement change. Appendix J - Finally, the Dissemination Tool guides you through ways you can disseminate your findings at conferences, in publications, in social media, and more.  Additional Tools for Critical Appraisal In addition to the evidence levels and grading found in the JHN EBP Model Tools, you may find that other tools can offer additional guidance and understanding:\n  CASP Checklists: This set of eight critical appraisal tools are designed to be used when reading research, these include tools for Systematic Reviews, Randomised Controlled Trials, Cohort Studies, Case Control Studies, Economic Evaluations, Diagnostic Studies, Qualitative studies and Clinical Prediction Rule.  Cochrane Collaboration\u0026rsquo;s Risk of Bias Tool: This set of eight critical appraisal tools are designed to be used when reading research, these include tools for Systematic Reviews, Randomised Controlled Trials, Cohort Studies, Case Control Studies, Economic Evaluations, Diagnostic Studies, Qualitative studies and Clinical Prediction Rule.  Dartmouth Biomedical Libraries: Dartmouth provides a series of worksheets designed to aid you in formulating clinical questions, appraising the evidence, and applying the evidence to practice.  The JADAD Scale for Reporting Randomized Controlled Trials: Jadad, A. R., Moore, R. A., Carroll, D., Jenkinson, C., Reynolds, D. J., Gavaghan, D. J., \u0026amp; McQuay, H. J. (1996).

GRADE Working Group: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (short GRADE) working group began in the year 2000 as an informal collaboration of people with an interest in addressing the shortcomings of grading systems in health care. The working group has developed a common, sensible and transparent approach to grading quality (or certainty) of evidence and strength of recommendations.  JAMA Series on Step-by-Step Critical Appraisal: Links to the \u0026lsquo;User\u0026rsquo;s Guides to the Medical Literature\u0026rsquo; series of articles designed to promote incorporation of evidence into practice.  Joanna Briggs Critical Appraisal Tools: JBI\u0026rsquo;s critical appraisal tools assist in assessing the trustworthiness, relevance, and results of published papers.  Newcastle-Ottawa Scale: The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) is an ongoing collaboration between the Universities of Newcastle, Australia and Ottawa, Canada. It was developed to assess the quality of nonrandomised studies with its design, content and ease of use directed to the task of incorporating the quality assessments in the interpretation of meta-analytic results.  OHAT Risk of Bias Rating Tool: The OHAT Risk of Bias Rating Tool can be used for human and animal studies.  Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence: The CEBM Levels of Evidence framework sets out one approach to systematizing this grading process for different question types.  SYRCLE\u0026rsquo;s Risk of Bias Tool: This tool is based on the Cochrane RoB tool and has been adjusted for aspects of bias that play a specific role in animal intervention studies. 9U.S. Preventive Services Task Force](https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/grade-definitions): he U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) assigns one of five letter grades (A, B, C, D, or I). The USPSTF changed its grade definitions based on a change in methods in May 2007 and again in July 2012, when it updated the definition of and suggestions for practice for the grade C recommendation.

It covers the areas of medicine, nursing, dentistry, veterinary medicine, health care systems, preclinical sciences, and related areas. PubMed is developed and maintained by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), both at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD. As of July, 2020, PubMed contains over 30 million records. PubMed is a platform that contains MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and additional PubMed records.\nPubMed Cool Tools Clinical Queries Use Clinical Queries to enable pre-made filters applying to different clinical research areas. Results are delineated into clinical studies, systematic reviews, and medical genetics. Enter your search exactly as you would in the PubMed search box.\nFor more information, see:\n Documentation on the Clinical Studies filters Documentation on the Systematic Reviews filters Documentation on the Medical Genetics filters  Journals in NCBI Databases Use Journals in NCBI Databases to limit your search to a specific journal or to find out more information about journals indexed in MEDLINE. text\nSingle Citation Matcher Use the Single Citation Matcher to find citations in PubMed. You may enter or omit any field.\nSpecial Queries Searchers at the National Library of Medicine have created search filters for multiple common topics. See and enable them on the PubMed Special Queries page.\nControlled Vocabulary: MeSH or Medical Subject Headings  MeSH Database\n MeSH stands for Medical Subject Headings. It is a controlled vocabulary of terms assigned to records to make them discoverable. These are a standardized set of terms that are used to bring consistency to the searching process. In total, there are approximately 29,000 MeSH terms, and they are updated annually to reflect changes in terminology. Use the MeSH database to identify Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) which will help you to find literature indexed with the MeSH term. Using MeSH terms helps account for variations in language, acronyms, and British vs. American English. MeSH can be searched from the MeSH Database. Terms are arranged hierarchically by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. MeSH terms in PubMed automatically include the more specific MeSH terms in a search. This is called \u0026ldquo;explode.\u0026rdquo; To turn off this automatic explode feature, click on the button next to, \u0026ldquo;Do not include MeSH terms found below this term in the MeSH hierarchy\u0026rdquo; in the MeSH record or type [mesh:noexp] next to the search term, e.g.neoplasms [mesh:noexp]. See next page for additional information on no explode. Use the PubMed Search Builder on the right side of the screen to add your selected MeSH term to the box, and click Search.  Explode, No Explode, and Major Heading  Explode will search with all narrower headings beneath the main heading you have chosen. PubMed will default to explode any MeSH term you search. No Explode will only search for your chosen MeSH term without including any of the narrower headings in the MeSH hierarchy. You can select this option from the MeSH record. Major Heading will narrow your search to only find MeSH terms listed as a major topic of an article. You can select this option from the MeSH record. Major headings are shown in the article record with an asterisk.  Subheadings MeSH terms can be made more specific by the addition of correlated or free-floating subheadings.\n When in the MeSH record, add subheadings by clicking on the boxes next to the desired subheadings. Then click \u0026ldquo;Add to Search Builder.\u0026rdquo; Warning: Adding too many subheadings may lead to missing important articles. MeSH/Subheading Combinations: You can manually add subheadings in the search box by using the format MeSH Term/Subheading, e.g. neoplasms/diet therapy. See abbreviations of MeSH subheadings, which can also be used. (MeSH Subheadings). For a MeSH/Subheading combination, only one subheading at a time may be directly attached to a MeSH term. For example, a search of Hypertension with the subheadings Diagnosis or Drug Therapy will appear as Hypertension/diagnosis [mesh] OR Hypertension/drug therapy[mesh]. As with MeSH terms, PubMed search results, by default, include the more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms for the MeSH term and also includes the more specific terms arranged beneath broader subheadings.  Keywords Automatic Term Mapping  PubMed uses Automatic Term Mapping (ATM) when you enter terms in the search box. Automatic Term Mapping means that the search terms you type into the search box are automatically mapped to MeSH terms. To see Automatic Term Mapping in action, click on the Details arrow in your Advanced \u0026gt; History and Search Details box. Using quotes around a phrase or truncation turns off Automatic Term Mapping. The terms are instead searched exactly as entered, with no mapping applied.  Using Keywords  Keywords can be any words used to describe your idea or concept. Keywords can be single words or phrases. Use quotes around all phrases to ensure that the phrase is searched together. For more ideas, visit the MeSH database and look at the entry terms listed in the MeSH record. Also consider using synonyms, acroynyms, initialisms, variations in spelling, and other closely-related terms used interchangeably to describe the topic.  Keyword Generation Keywords can be generated by:\n browsing entry terms in PubMed\u0026rsquo;s MeSH, and synonyms in Embase\u0026rsquo;s Emtree to add additional keywords to a concept; looking at a few key articles and seeing how the terminology is used; and by doing a few preliminary searches and browsing the results to see how the terminology is used.  Additional Pro Tips Filters You can use filters to narrow your search results by article type, text availability, publication date, species, language, sex, subject, journal category, and age. See more on Filters on PubMed\u0026rsquo;s Help guide.\n On the left side of the results are options to filter your search. You can access additional filters through the link at the bottom of the filters bar. \u0026ldquo;Text availability\u0026rdquo; is for users who are not affiliated with an institution. You do not need to limit by text availability since you have access to the JH Catalog and Interlibrary Loan. Use filters cautiously. Limits other than date or language will limit your search to MeSH-indexed records only. For example, if you would like to limit your results to \u0026ldquo;human studies,\u0026rdquo; use the following search to exclude animal studies instead of using the \u0026ldquo;humans\u0026rdquo; limit from the search results page. Simply add this to the end of your search:   \u0026hellip;NOT (animals[MeSH Terms] NOT humans[MeSH Terms])\n Phrase Searching Surround phrases with double quotes to search as a phrase to use a more specific search with more precision, and not as disparate words, which will result in a more sensitive search with higher recall. See more on Phrase Searching on PubMed\u0026rsquo;s Help guide.\n \u0026ldquo;hospital acquired infection\u0026rdquo; will return the phrase instead of hospital AND acquired AND infection\n ###Truncation\nIn PubMed you can use a * at the root of a word to find multiple endings. For example:\n arthroplast* will return arthroplasty, arthroplasties, arthroplastic, arthroplastics, etc.\n  mobili* will return mobility, mobilization, mobilisation, mobilize, etc.\n Note: In New PubMed, you can now truncate a phrase inside quotes. \u0026ldquo;catheter infection*\u0026rdquo; will return catheter infections. See more on on Truncation on PubMed\u0026rsquo;s Help guide.\nField Tags or Field Descriptors Use search field tags to specify in which field the database queries for the search term. In PubMed, first type the search term and then the search field tag in brackets. e.g. Cardiology [tiab] searches for cardiology in the title and abstract.\n [All Fields] or [all] – Untagged terms and terms tagged with [all fields] are processed using Automatic Term Mapping. Terms enclosed in double quotes or truncated will be searched in all fields and not processed using automatic term mapping. [Text Words] or [tw] – Includes all words and numbers in the title, abstract, other abstract, MeSH terms, MeSH Subheadings, Publication Types, Substance Names, Personal Name as Subject, Corporate Author, Secondary Source, Comment/Correction Notes, and Other Terms. [Title/Abstract] or [tiab] – Words and numbers included in the title, collection title, abstract, and other abstract of a citation. English language abstracts are taken directly from the published article. If an article does not have a published abstract, NLM does not create one.

Use the tools for search creation, searching platforms, and search translation.\nSearch Tools    2Dsearch 2Dsearch is a radical alternative to conventional \u0026lsquo;advanced search\u0026rsquo;. Instead of entering Boolean strings into one-dimensional search boxes, queries are formulated by combining objects on a two-dimensional canvas. This eliminates syntax errors, makes the query semantics more transparent, and offers a more effective way to optimize, save and share search strategies.\n   BioReader BioReader can help you distill your reading list by ranking articles by relevance. Simply collect the PubMed IDs of a number of articles you found relevant and a similar number of articles not relevant to you. BioReader will provide you with a ranked reading list to limit the time wasted on reading irrelevant literature.\n   MeSH on Demand MeSH on Demand identifies MeSH® terms in your submitted text (abstract or manuscript). MeSH on Demand also lists PubMed similar articles relevant to your submitted text.\n   PubReMiner PubReMiner will query PubMed with your specified search query, get all abstracts and generate frequency tables.\n   PubVenn PubVenn enables you to explore PubMed using venn diagrams.\n   Yale MeSH Analyzer Librarians have long analyzed Medical Subject Headings to design and refine searches. A MeSH analysis grid can help identify the problems in your search strategy by presenting the ways articles are indexed in the MEDLINE database in an easy-to-scan tabular format.\n  Search Translation    MEDLINE Transpose MEDLINE Transpose was developed to mitigate a common problem among information specialists: converting search syntax between PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE interfaces.\n   Polyglot Search via SR Accelerator The IEBH SR-Accelerator is a suite of tools to speed up steps in the Systematic Review (SR) process. It is freely available for anyone in the world to use. Simply register below with your name and email address. The SRA is a modular design which means the tools can be incorporated into existing SR workflows and combined with other automation tools.\n  Search Platforms    Medxrivr Medxrivr allows you to perform advanced search and batch export in Medrxiv. Documentation is available on GitHub.\n   Publibee Publibee is a platform developed by Stanford University individuals that uses PubMed data and maintains Legacy PubMed functionality.\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ea71ccc73806ac73a65b5dfd0444f3ef","permalink":"https://carrieprice78.github.io/courses/systematic-reviews/search-tools/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/systematic-reviews/search-tools/","section":"courses","summary":"Keep in mind current search reporting trends.\nThe following tools will aid in creating a sensitive search that includes the types of articles that would be relevant to your review.

Keep this in your existing search document, which can be either a text or spreadsheet format.\nWhy Document? In the interest of evidence-based medicine and open science, you should know how you arrived at the results that you did. To that end, your search should be reproducible and transparent, so that anyone replicating your search could arrive at the same set of results.\nIncreasingly, journal editors are requesting the search strategy to be submitted as an appendix along with the manuscript. This will help you describe your search methodology in your publications and provide the steps which you used.\nSaving your search will also save you time later.

You will find that many databases use their own controlled vocabularies (sometimes called index terms, subject headings, or a thesaurus) to enhance the findability of citations. If you have heard of MeSH, this stands for Medical Subject Headings, and is the controlled vocabulary used in PubMed.\nDatabases that use controlled vocabularies employ subject specialists who review individual citations and add the appropriate controlled vocabulary terms to the citation that describe all of the concepts covered in the article. Using controlled vocabulary terms in your search strategy allows you to locate citations no matter what term(s) an author does or does not use, and helps account for spelling variations and acronyms.\nMethods for Finding Controlled Vocabulary Terms  Do a basic keyword search and choose a few citations that are relevant to your research question. Make a note of any keywords used in the article title or citation you may wish to add to your current list of keywords. Examine the full citation information for each article to find the controlled vocabulary terms assigned and write them down. Redo your search using both the controlled vocabulary and keyword terms.  Keywords Keywords are the words used in an article title, abstract, or other text field in a database. Keyword searching, or natural language searching, is how most people search for information and is often sufficient for most people. One drawback of searching with keywords is that the words that you use must match the terms used by an author. To remedy this problem, a complete keyword search strategy will include multiple spellings and synonyms that represent the concept. Keyword searching is also useful when attempting to identify literature that may not have been indexed with controlled vocabulary terms, for any variety of reasons.\nCombining Search Terms Effectively Boolean operators form the basis of mathematical sets and database logic. Using these terms to combine concepts and keywords in your search will assist you in performing a transparent, reproducible, and thorough search. Boolean operators include AND, OR, and NOT. These are generally always capitalized.\n AND - AND is used to link ideas and concepts where you want to see both ideas or concepts in your search results. AND narrows the search.   \u0026ldquo;children\u0026rdquo; AND \u0026ldquo;poverty\u0026rdquo;\n  OR - OR is used between similar keywords, like synonyms, acronyms, and variations in spelling within the same idea or concept. OR broadens the search.   \u0026ldquo;behavior\u0026rdquo; OR \u0026ldquo;behaviour\u0026rdquo;\n  NOT - NOT is used to exclude specific keywords from the search, however, you will want to use NOT with caution because you may end up missing something important. NOT is used to make broad exclusions. In this example, any article that discusses both \u0026ldquo;pediatrics\u0026rdquo; as well as \u0026ldquo;adults\u0026rdquo; will be excluded.   \u0026ldquo;pediatrics\u0026rdquo; NOT \u0026ldquo;adults\u0026rdquo;\n Searching Best Practice: Combine Controlled Vocabulary with Keywords It is good practice to search with both controlled vocabulary and keywords. Here are a few reasons:\n Not every database uses a controlled vocabulary (Scopus and Web of Science are two examples) Each database may have its own controlled vocabulary terms If an article is too new, it may not be indexed with controlled vocabulary yet, and you would only find it with keywords In PubMed, if an article is out of scope of MEDLINE, a component of PubMed, it may not ever be indexed with MeSH (PubMed\u0026rsquo;s controlled vocabulary), and you would only find it with keywords If an article lacks an abstract or additional author-supplied keywords, you may only find it with controlled vocabulary  If you want to be as comprehensive as possible, search with both controlled vocabulary and keywords.\nUse Caution In bibliographic databases, stop words are words that the database has been programmed to ignore in a search string or query. Stop words include of, the, is, at, which,and on. Avoid using stopwords in your searches.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"aeae9936c412d3bc467ac28df58e1b0a","permalink":"https://carrieprice78.github.io/courses/expert-searching/generate-terms/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/expert-searching/generate-terms/","section":"courses","summary":"Controlled Vocabulary Controlled vocabularies are a set of predetermined terms that describe specific concepts.

Literature databases index citations provided by publishers. Some databases only index journal articles (such as PubMed) while other databases index additional items such as conference proceedings, dissertations, and book chapters.\nDatabase publishers assign each part of a citation to a different field in the database. For example, all authors listed for an articles are assigned to the \u0026ldquo;Author\u0026rdquo; field, all words in an abstract are assigned to the \u0026ldquo;Abstract\u0026rdquo; field, etc. Many databases also add controlled vocabulary terms to describe the major concepts presented in an article which are then tagged as such. Any search terms you use are only searched across the citation information in a database, not the full text of the article.\nSearching using specific fields of a citation in literature databases increases the precision of your search by dictating which part of the citation a specific keyword or phrase must appear. This is useful if you want to find articles on a specific topic that were written by a particular author or originated from a specific institution or are published in a specific journal.\nA way to search for terms in a specific field of a citation is to add a \u0026ldquo;Field Tag\u0026rdquo; to your search terms. Most databases allow you to qualify search terms using a code called a \u0026ldquo;Field Tag\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;Field Descriptor\u0026rdquo; to force the database to only search for that term in a specific field.\nUse Database Filters Many databases allow you to apply filters to limit to your search. For example, you can apply a language filter to limit your search results to articles written in a specific language. You should be extremely careful about how you apply these filters.\nIn most databases, these filters will appear on the left side after you run a search. The most commonly used filters include article or publication type, and publication dates.\nAvoid applying filters that will unnecessarily exclude articles you may want to see. These include filters such as species, ages, text availability, and subject discipline. When you apply these filters, you are using controlled vocabulary or database indexing to exclude articles. This is not always a reliable method of excluding articles, and in these cases you may wish to work with your informationist to discuss the best approach.\nForward and Backward Citation Searching If you find an article that is very relevant, search the reference list to identify other literature that may be pertinent to your research. Conversely, some databases will show you which articles have cited that article.\nSimilar Articles in PubMed In PubMed, there is a feature called \u0026ldquo;Similar Articles.\u0026rdquo; Click on this option to find other articles that are indexed in a similar way to the one you chose. You can find it on the right-hand menu inside the article record, and at the bottom of the article page.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7a260d66e5d0a2a09927c206824350e5","permalink":"https://carrieprice78.github.io/courses/expert-searching/pro-tips/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/expert-searching/pro-tips/","section":"courses","summary":"Search by Database Fields Use database fields to search with specific parts of a citation.

You\u0026rsquo;ll know that you search the appropriate databases, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to document the search correctly. Searches should be documented and reproducible in the context of evidence-based medicine.\nDatabase A database indexes individual records with metadata. Records are searched through simple or complex queries. Bibliographic literature databases index scholarly literature. A search in a bibliographic literature database will return publications. Different databases index different sources, such as publishers and journals, and they vary in scope. A well-documented search in a database can be reproducible and transparent. Examples of a database: Embase, Scopus, Web of Science.\nPlatform A platform is a search interface. It may host individual databases or simply act as a search engine. Platform searches are typically not reproducible, since it is unclear which databases were searched and how they were searched. Examples of a platform: EBSCOhost, ProQuest, Google, TRIP.\nWhich Databases to Search In addition to connecting with a librarian for recommendations of the best available resources, you might find that Google and Wikipedia are helpful. Perform some searches to identify recommended databases for your topic. Your librarian will be able to determine access for these resources.\n  Wikipedia: List of academic databases and search engines  It will be useful, if your goal is a thorough survey of the literature, to search more than one database.
