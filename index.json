I\u0026rsquo;ll share what worked best for me.\nAs the content and number of guides grew, I found it helpful to have at least three internal guides, as defined below. If working at an institution that has a lot of guides, it might be helpful to have these types of internal guides for each group, college, or discipline.\nBest Practices Guide (Internal) Use your best practices guide internally. It should provide guidance to other LibGuide developers. I included sections for:\nAccessibility Links  Avoid using the words such as \u0026ldquo;link\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;here\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;for more information\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; in your linked text. Screen readers will recognize the href HTML tag as a link. Linked text should make sense out of context. It should describe the link.  Copy Use heading element tags (h3, h4, h5) instead of text decoration (bold, underline, italic) so that screen readers can identify headings and sections\nImages Include short descriptive text as alt text (alternative text) for images so that screen readers can describe the image to the viewer\nWhat is an Accessible PDF? An accessible PDF:\n has readable text - is not an image has tags to indicate a heading structure has alternate text for images has a set reading order so that it can be read by a screen reader has a set language  Make sure that your uploaded accessible documents have alternative text and a thumbnail image. Using Adobe Acrobat Pro to Ensure Accessibility\nUse Adobe Acrobat Pro to create accessible PDFs.\nGo to Tools \u0026gt; Action Wizard, and follow the steps to prepare your PDF for accessibility.\nSee more on the Adobe Acrobat Pro User Guide.\nWhat is Alternative Text? Alternative text helps screen readers recognize and describe images used on websites. An image without alternative text cannot be described in context.\n Use alternative text when including an image in your guide. Alternative text is read by screen readers in place of images. Enter accurate text that avoids terminology such as \u0026ldquo;image of\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;link to\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. See WebAIM\u0026rsquo;s section on alternative text.  Color Make a list of colors that are allowed on the guides and note their Hex and RGB values. I used a table for this and noted which elements which colors should correspond to, such as box headers, footer, links, complementary colors.\nLink to your institutional brand pages, which should reflect your choices of color.\nEditorial Guidelines Here is where you can standardize terminology, grammar, and puncutation, fonts, and other materials such as PowerPoints and presentations for the whole library. I used tables inside a tabbed box for this purpose.\nYou can also specify how users should create friendly URLs or slugs for their guide pages. See Compound Domain names from the Nielsen Norman Group.\nLink to your institutional brand pages, which should reflect your choices of fonts.\nResponsive Design LibGuides has Bootstrap built in to the platform. Bootstrap makes it easy to make content appear beautifully across a variety of devices. CSS Grid can also be used within a box.\nDo not use tables for formatting. Tables should only be used for tabular content. LibGuides contains Bootstrap pre-formatted tables that you can select for look and feel.\nYou may wish to create a CSS Grid inside a box for a more customized look than Bootstrap. Two CSS Grids are also available in the Reusable Content tab. Make a copy and edit the text if you\u0026rsquo;d like to use them.\nEmbed responsive images by setting width to 100% with the height left blank.\nAlso note how you should embed resopnsive media, usually with a div class. See Boostrap\u0026rsquo;s Documentation on Responsive Embeds.\nSite Documentation Upload your current documents to a site documentation page on the best practices guide, and keep it updated.\n customized CSS header code footer code subjects and tags metadata logos embedded icon collections favicon  Guide Maintenance Making a New Guide Ensure the need for a new guide by first checking with your manager. To create a new guide, choose Create Guide in the LibGuides system. The default navigation is Side Nav.\nAdding Assets, Links, and Databases Before you add a new asset (link) or database to the system, check to make sure that one doesn\u0026rsquo;t already exist. You can do this from Content \u0026gt; Assets or Content \u0026gt; A-Z Database List on the LibGuides toolbar.\n Links should be added to Assets Only databases should be added to Databases  Retiring Your Guide If a guide is no longer relevant, consider setting its status to Private or Unpublished.\nYou are free to delete your own content and your own guides when appropriate if it is not being mapped to other guides.\nMaintaining Your Guide Ensure that your guide\u0026rsquo;s links are still active. Find the Link Checker under Tools in the LibGuides toolbar. The schedule for link checking is January and July of every year.\nKeep Your Profile Up to Date Keep your profile up to date. You can do this by navigating to LibApps \u0026gt; Profile in the toolbar.\nProfiles should include at a minimum:\n Photo Email Address  Include a Help Area Make sure that LibGuide builders know who to contact for help, and where they can find additional training.\n  LibGuides Community Sites  Springshare Help Center  Springshare Training  It may also be helpful to link to tools that will help budding web developers try out some new techniques, like:\n  Bootstrap  Bootstrap Documentation  CSS Grid on w3 Schools  CSS Zen Garden  Font Awesome Integration  JS Fiddle  TryIt Editor from w3 Schools  Storage and Reusable Elements Guide (Internal) I used the storage guide to keep reusable boxes that appeared frequently on many guides. I also used a storage guide to display resuable elements like headers, boxes, and other customized CSS or HTML elements. A user could see what it looked like before using the code in their own site. Users could also simply reuse a box that had the correct information, and the boxes could be updated from one place.\nYou might also consider adding a sandbox page here, so that users can try out different designs before going live.\nReusable Pages Guide (Internal) As the content grew, I realized that it was better to have a reusable pages guide as well. Reusable pages are for things that require more than just a few boxes, like a process, a course, a lesson plan, or a database tipsheet. Users could map to the page, and the pages could be updated from one place.\n","date":1597190400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1597190400,"objectID":"7f01621a7a8a0bde2e4a01758e780bdd","permalink":"https://carrieprice78.github.io/guides/libguides/","publishdate":"2020-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/guides/libguides/","section":"guides","summary":"Best practices for librarians building LibGuides.","tags":null,"title":"LibGuides","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A collection of resources for nursing students and practicing nurses.\nSome of the content of this guide was originally created by me for the Welch Medical Library Nursing Resources Research Guide at Johns Hopkins University.\n","date":1597190400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1597190400,"objectID":"28818ff3a98ae9cc0fa8d6c7a2ff510c","permalink":"https://carrieprice78.github.io/guides/nursing-resources/","publishdate":"2020-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/guides/nursing-resources/","section":"guides","summary":"Resources for nursing students and practicing nurses.","tags":null,"title":"Nursing Resources","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Preprint Repositories   medRxiv  bioRxiv  OSF Preprints  Open Access Journals   DOAJ: Directory of Open Access Journals  Open Access Databases   LOADB: Listing of Open Access Databases  Free Apps for Clinical Care   AHRQ ePSS (USPSTF recommendations)  American College of Physicians (ACP) Clinical Practice Guidelines and Recommendations  ASCVD Risk Estimator (by the American College of Cardiology)  Calculate by QxMD (medical calculators and screening tools)  CDC Vaccine Schedules  Epocrates (drug reference)  Medscape (medical news, education, and clinical reference)  Read by QxMD (articles, research)  The content on some of these guides was originally created for the Welch Medical Library Research Guides at Johns Hopkins University.\n","date":1597190400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1597190400,"objectID":"304742d4197fdddbe36143ab2422e820","permalink":"https://carrieprice78.github.io/guides/open-access/","publishdate":"2020-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/guides/open-access/","section":"guides","summary":"Resources for authors.","tags":null,"title":"Publishing and Open Access","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Resources for clinicians working in rehabilitation research.

Research metrics, also called bibliometrics or citation metrics, are quantitative measurements designed to help you or others evaluate research outputs. They might include measurements such as times an article is cited, journal impact factor measurements, social media mentions, the h-index, news media mentions, and more. Some of these metrics are more traditional than others, but all of them can be used demonstrate the impact of your work.\nResearch metrics, when used responsibly, can help you tell a story about your research career; research metrics can help you enhance your impact in your field and beyond.\nTips for Reaching a Wider Audience To help ensure that you can publish your work in an open access repository after publishing it in a for-profit journal, make sure to thoroughly review the publisher copyright form(s) associated with your work and, if necessary, stipulate that you want to retain rights over your work.\nThe majority of for-profit publishers will allow publishing authors to make this demand in the form an addendum, but the responsibility falls with you to know your rights. Look for your journal in Sherpa Romeo for a summary of publishers\u0026rsquo; open access archiving conditions and policies for individual journals. Use this SPARC Author Addendum to help you retain certain rights to your research.\nAccording to Piwowar et al., 2018, the rate of open access research has grown rapidly over the years, and OA research receives 18% more citations than average. For researchers who lack funds or institutional credentials to access research behind paywalls, open access also promotes equitable access to scholarship, allowing researchers everywhere barrier-free access to scholarly innovations.\nCreate a Website for Your Research or Study Network If your publication is part of a larger research project, or if you belong to a research network, consider creating a website to communicate the aims of the study, the patient population, sources of funding, researchers involved, and any resulting publications. Study websites are especially important if you are planning to recruit participants for your project because they can help communicate and translate the research in a way that non-researcher communities can more-easily understand.\nConsider creating a public-facing Zotero library to show visitors the publications resulting from your study.\nConduct outreach via social media channels such as Twitter to raise awareness about your work and reach a wider audience.\nWordPress, Squarespace, and Drupal are recommended content management systems for managing online content.\nRemove Errors or Duplications in Your Research Profile If you happen to find errors in your research output, such as missing documents, incorrect names or affiliations, or duplicates of your profile or work, contact the publisher or database host. The links below are some recommended methods for fixing errors:\n  Elsevier\u0026rsquo;s instructions for requesting corrections  PubMed: Can an error in a citation be corrected?  PubMed: Reporting Errors  PubMed: I found an error; how do I get it fixed?  Scopus: Check, Correct, Submit: Hot to Ensure Accuracy in Your Scopus Author Profile  NIH Biosketch and Grant Applications When preparing your NIH Biosketch for a grant application, try to articulate how your scholarship has impacted your research field.\nThe contributions to science section of the NIH Biosketch can be enhanced by contextualizing the background of your research area and by emphasizing the impact your research has made in the field. If your field has been altered by one or more of your publications, articulate this impact by describing how your research findings have influenced technology, public health policy, or standards of care, and describe your role in the research or study.\nMetrics worth considering to enhance the your NIH Biosketch or grant applications include: mean citation rate, median citation rate, portfolio h-index, median Relative Citation Ratio (RCR), percentage of articles in the top 10% of citations, the number of guidelines supported, and/or the number of patents supported.\n  NIH\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Biosketch Format Pages, Instructions, and Samples  Altmetric\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Using Altmetric Data in Your NIH Biosketch CV  Examples from Altmetric\u0026rsquo;s guide include statements such as:\n This article, in particular, has had a relatively large effect upon the field of biophysics, receiving among the top 5% of social media and other online attention (compared to other research published in the same journal and time frame, according to Altmetric.com).\n or\n This research has received international news coverage from major news outlets including the New York Times, reaching millions worldwide.

Instead of entering Boolean strings into one-dimensional search boxes, queries are formulated by combining objects on a two-dimensional canvas. This eliminates syntax errors, makes the query semantics more transparent, and offers a more effective way to optimize, save and share search strategies.  BioReader: BioReader can help you distill your reading list by ranking articles by relevance. Simply collect the PubMed IDs of a number of articles you found relevant and a similar number of articles not relevant to you. BioReader will provide you with a ranked reading list to limit the time wasted on reading irrelevant literature.  Medrxivr: Medxrivr allows you to perform advanced search and batch export in Medrxiv. Documentation available at Github.  Publibee: Publibee is a platform developed by Stanford University individuals that uses PubMed data and maintains Legacy PubMed functionality.  PubReMiner: PubReMiner will query PubMed with your specified search query, get all abstracts and generate frequency tables.  PubVenn: PubVenn enables you to explore PubMed using venn diagrams.  Search Translating Tools   MEDLINE Transpose: MEDLINE Transpose was developed to mitigate a common problem among information specialists: converting search syntax between PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE interfaces.  Polyglot Search via SR Accelerator: The IEBH SR-Accelerator is a suite of tools to speed up steps in the Systematic Review (SR) process. It is freely available for anyone in the world to use.

Mark all tweets about the event with the chosen hashtag. Ask the conference team to create or share their Twitter handles. Tag them in the Tweets when appropriate (on authored papers, on events where they are presenting, etc.). Put together a master list of event-related Twitter users for the event that participants can follow and tag.  Getting Started  Download the Twitter app to your smartphone or use the Twitter website or both. Register for an account. Add a professional photo and write a brief bio about your areas of interest. You can use hashtags in your bio to be more easily discoverable. Follow users and accounts in your areas of interest. Check your Twitter feed once or twice a day to like and retweet content of interest, or respond to others\u0026rsquo; tweets to start a respectful discussion. When you feel comfortable, you can begin tweeting on your own.  Becoming a Twitter Pro  Keep a separate professional account and refrain from engaging in sensitive topics, like politics, from your professional account. Use a professional photo so that you are recognizable to your peers. Retain personal boundaries and be mindful of giving out too much identifying information since all the information is public. Don\u0026rsquo;t tweet anything you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say out loud in public. Photos, GIFs, graphics, and links receive more engagements than just text. You can incorporate polls into your tweets to get feedback from key stakeholder groups.  Ethics in the Twitterverse  DO ask permission to share photos of colleagues and peers before posting. DO cite your sources. DO stick to professional and collegial discourse. DON\u0026rsquo;T share patient information or photographs without explicit consent. DON\u0026rsquo;T diagnose or give medical medical advice. DON\u0026rsquo;T share speaker slides if they ask you not to. DON\u0026rsquo;T share unpublished data.   Reference: Barnes, S.

If your goal is a literature review, understand the type of literature review and the methodology involved. This step is a good time to do some preliminary background searching to get an idea of what\u0026rsquo;s already been done. Hint: look for a question development framework that will help you frame your topic.\nAssess How You Plan to Search In which databases would you expect to find relevant literature? This is the perfect time to ask a librarian or an information professional for guidance. Your project cannot be adequately supported with Google or Wikipedia. See your institution\u0026rsquo;s site for database suggestions and a connection to the library.\nFormulating Your Research Topic  Gather background information on your topic. Do a quick search to see what\u0026rsquo;s been written about the topic so far. Consider your audience. Who will be interested in this issue? Identify a question framework to use to acheive clarity in the research question. Solicit input from collaborators, peers, and mentors.

It may include data from any type of evidence and research methodology. It can be used as a standalone project or as a preliminary step to a systematic review.\n Tricco, A.C., Lillie, E., Zarin, W., O\u0026rsquo;Brien, K.K., Colquhoun, H., Levac, D., Moher, D., Peters, M.D.J., Horsley, T., Weeks, L., Hempel, S., Akl, E.A., Chang, C., McGowan, J., Stewart, L., Hartling, L., Aldcroft, A., Wilson, M.G., Garritty, C., Lewin, S., Godfrey, C.M., Macdonald, M.T., Langlois, E.V., Soares-Weiser, K., Moriarty, J., Clifford, T., Tunçalp Ö., Straus, S.E.

It traditionally brings together evidence from the quantitative literature to answer questions on the effectiveness of a specific intervention for a particular condition.\n Higgins, J. P. T., Green, S. (editors). Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1.0 [updated March 2011]. The Cochrane Collaboration, 2011. Available from http://handbook.cochrane.org.  Rapid Review A rapid review provides a rapid synthesis of knowledge about a policy or clinical practice issue and attempts to inform an evidence-based decision as soon as possible. It follows all of the stages of a systematic knowledge synthesis but may modify a stage to shorten the timescale.\n Khangura, S., Konnyu, K., Cushman, R., Grimshaw, J., \u0026amp; Moher, D. (2012).

It was intended to be an unbiased way of comparing people within a discipline, especially in the sciences. The h-index is a reflection of both the number of publication and the number of citations per publication. For example, an h-index of 25 means the researcher has published at least 25 papers, each of which has been cited at least 25 or more times.\nThe h-index can be found in Web of Science, Scopus, or Google. Your h-index may vary depending on which of these resources you consult because it is calculated based on the citations indexed by each.\nCaveats to using the h-index:\n The h-index cannot be used to compare researchers in different disciplines due to differences in citations practices. The h-index can put early career researchers at a disadvantage since citations tend to increase over time should not be used as the only indicator to evaluate a researcher.  Finding your h-Index with Scopus Scopus has built-in features that make it easy to quickly find your h-index and create basic visualizations about a set of citations. You can use these features to discover the journals where you most frequently publish, view a network of your co-authors, and more.\n To find your h-index in Scopus and view all of your citations, use the \u0026ldquo;Author\u0026rdquo; search feature to locate your author profile. Click on your name on the results page to view your \u0026ldquo;Author Details\u0026rdquo; page in Scopus. Your h-index will be displayed to the right of your name.  Finding your h-Index with Web of Science Web of Science has built-in features that make it easy to quickly find your h-index and create basic visualizations about a set of citations. You can use these features to discover the journals where you most frequently publish, view a network of your co-authors, and more.\nSee more from Web of Science and their author or search analytics functions on their guide.\nThe Citation Report feature in Web of Science automatically calculates the h-index, average number of citations per publication, and the sum of all citations (with or without self-citations) for a group of citations. To find your own h-index, use the \u0026ldquo;Author Search\u0026rdquo; feature to locate all of your citations to use as the citation pool to be analyzed. Data can be exported to a Microsoft Excel file for further analysis.\nWhy Establish a Researcher Profile? Creating and maintaining a unique public profile for the dissemination and promotion of your research is key to establishing your identity as a researcher. A researcher profile serves as a persistent identifier linking together your scholarly output throughout your career. A research profile can:\n Link all variations and changes to your name to one profile Disambiguate yourself from other researchers with the same or similar name Associate all of your publications throughout your career across multiple departments and institutional affiliations Enhance discoverability of your work by potential collaborators Make creating publication lists of your work fast and easy Allow you to take advantage of enhanced database features, such as tracking your h-index and and other research metrics  ORCID  ORCID is an acronym for \u0026ldquo;Open Researcher and Contributor ID.\u0026rdquo; ORCID is an independent, non-profit, community-based registry of unique research identifiers that allows researchers to create and maintain their own researcher profile. Researchers can include their education, work history, citations, and other research output in a single profile. Profile content can be imported by linking your ORCID profile to a Scopus Author ID or the Web of Science Publons, or by manually adding data from PubMed or other sources.\nSciENcv  SciENcv, the Science Experts Network Curriculum Vitae, is a researcher profile system for all individuals who apply for, receive, or are associated with research investments from U.S.federal agencies. SciENcv is available in My NCBI.\nGoogle Scholar  Google Scholar is a search engine that searches the web for scholarly and peer reviewed literature. Google Scholar allows authors to create and maintain a profile page. Sign in to your Google Account and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to review your profile.\nScopus Scopus, a blbliographic literature database from Elsevier, automatically creates an Author ID for authors as new citations are added to the database. An algorithm attempts to link citations with similar attributes to an Author ID. You can find your Author ID and make any corrections to the citations associated with your profile.\nPublons from Clarivate Analytics  Publons (formerly ResearcherID) is the peer review activity tracker and researcher profile solution developed by Clarivate Analytics, the parent company of the Web of Science database. Upon registering, you are assigned a unique identifier you can use to manage your publication list, track citations to your work, and view your h-index, as well as a record of your work as a peer reviewer.\n","date":1597190400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597190400,"objectID":"c72d25fe1c1f6ebfe984edf3dd0271a2","permalink":"https://carrieprice78.github.io/guides/research-impact/author-metrics/","publishdate":"2020-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/guides/research-impact/author-metrics/","section":"guides","summary":"Author Metrics The h-Index The h-index is a common metric that attempts to measure both the productivity and impact of the published work of a scientist or scholar.

Keyword searching, or natural language searching, is how most people search for information and is often sufficient. One drawback of searching with keywords is that the words that you use must match the terms used by an author.\nTo remedy this problem, a complete keyword search strategy will include multiple spellings and synonyms that represent the concept. Keyword searching is also useful when attempting to identify literature that may not have been indexed with controlled vocabulary terms, for any variety of reasons.\nThink of synonyms, acronyms, antonyms, and initialisms associated with the concepts in your topic. See how other authors refer to your topic. Start by keeping a list in a document.\nKeyword Generation Tips  If looking for prevention, you will also need to look for causation. Review MeSH or other database controlled vocabularies to find related terms Look at relevant articles on your topic to find potential keywords Browse a dictionary, thesaurus, or encyclopedia  Using Keywords  Keywords can be any words used to describe your idea or concept. Keywords can be single words or phrases. Use quotes around all phrases to ensure that the phrase is searched together. For more ideas, visit the MeSH database and look at the entry terms listed in the MeSH record.

Keyword Generation Keywords can be generated by:\n browsing entry terms in PubMed\u0026rsquo;s MeSH, and synonyms in Embase\u0026rsquo;s Emtree to add additional keywords to a concept; looking at a few key articles and seeing how the terminology is used; and by doing a few preliminary searches and browsing the results to see how the terminology is used.

It allows for the inclusion of several study designs (e.g. experimental/nonexperimental, theoretical studies/empirical literature). It is also known as a “comprehensive review” or a “critical overview.”\n Torraco, R. J. (2005). Writing integrative literature reviews: guidelines and examples.

Instead of entering Boolean strings into one-dimensional search boxes, queries are formulated by combining objects on a two-dimensional canvas. This eliminates syntax errors, makes the query semantics more transparent, and offers a more effective way to optimize, save and share search strategies.\n   BioReader BioReader can help you distill your reading list by ranking articles by relevance. Simply collect the PubMed IDs of a number of articles you found relevant and a similar number of articles not relevant to you. BioReader will provide you with a ranked reading list to limit the time wasted on reading irrelevant literature.\n   MeSH on Demand MeSH on Demand identifies MeSH® terms in your submitted text (abstract or manuscript). MeSH on Demand also lists PubMed similar articles relevant to your submitted text.\n   PubReMiner PubReMiner will query PubMed with your specified search query, get all abstracts and generate frequency tables.\n   PubVenn PubVenn enables you to explore PubMed using venn diagrams.\n   Yale MeSH Analyzer Librarians have long analyzed Medical Subject Headings to design and refine searches. A MeSH analysis grid can help identify the problems in your search strategy by presenting the ways articles are indexed in the MEDLINE database in an easy-to-scan tabular format.\n  Search Translation    MEDLINE Transpose MEDLINE Transpose was developed to mitigate a common problem among information specialists: converting search syntax between PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE interfaces.\n   Polyglot Search via SR Accelerator The IEBH SR-Accelerator is a suite of tools to speed up steps in the Systematic Review (SR) process.

Some databases, like PubMed, use controlled vocabulary subject headings. See if subject headings exist for the concepts represented in your topic. Look at how they are indexed and what kinds of articles you find when you search with them. Collect your controlled vocabulary terms in your document.\nControlled vocabularies are a set of predetermined terms that describe specific concepts. You will find that many databases use their own controlled vocabularies (sometimes called index terms, subject headings, or a thesaurus) to enhance the findability of citations. If you have heard of MeSH, this stands for Medical Subject Headings, and is the controlled vocabulary used in PubMed.\nDatabases that use controlled vocabularies employ subject specialists who review individual citations and add the appropriate controlled vocabulary terms to the citation that describe all of the concepts covered in the article. Using controlled vocabulary terms in your search strategy allows you to locate citations no matter what term(s) an author does or does not use, and helps account for spelling variations and acronyms.\nControlled Vocabulary: MeSH or Medical Subject Headings  MeSH Database\n MeSH stands for Medical Subject Headings. It is a controlled vocabulary of terms assigned to records to make them discoverable. These are a standardized set of terms that are used to bring consistency to the searching process. In total, there are approximately 29,000 MeSH terms, and they are updated annually to reflect changes in terminology. Use the MeSH database to identify Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) which will help you to find literature indexed with the MeSH term. Using MeSH terms helps account for variations in language, acronyms, and British vs. American English. MeSH can be searched from the MeSH Database. Terms are arranged hierarchically by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. MeSH terms in PubMed automatically include the more specific MeSH terms in a search. This is called \u0026ldquo;explode.\u0026rdquo; To turn off this automatic explode feature, click on the button next to, \u0026ldquo;Do not include MeSH terms found below this term in the MeSH hierarchy\u0026rdquo; in the MeSH record or type [mesh:noexp] next to the search term, e.g.neoplasms [mesh:noexp]. See next page for additional information on no explode. Use the PubMed Search Builder on the right side of the screen to add your selected MeSH term to the box, and click Search.  Explode, No Explode, and Major Heading  Explode will search with all narrower headings beneath the main heading you have chosen. PubMed will default to explode any MeSH term you search. No Explode will only search for your chosen MeSH term without including any of the narrower headings in the MeSH hierarchy. You can select this option from the MeSH record. Major Heading will narrow your search to only find MeSH terms listed as a major topic of an article. You can select this option from the MeSH record. Major headings are shown in the article record with an asterisk.

Searches should be documented and reproducible in the context of evidence-based medicine.\nDatabase A database indexes individual records with metadata. Records are searched through simple or complex queries. Bibliographic literature databases index scholarly literature. A search in a bibliographic literature database will return publications. Different databases index different sources, such as publishers and journals, and they vary in scope. A well-documented search in a database can be reproducible and transparent. Examples of a database: Embase, Scopus, Web of Science.\nPlatform A platform is a search interface. It may host individual databases or simply act as a search engine. Platform searches are typically not reproducible, since it is unclear which databases were searched and how they were searched. Examples of a platform: EBSCOhost, ProQuest, Google, TRIP.\nWhich Databases to Search In addition to connecting with a librarian for recommendations of the best available resources, you might find that Google and Wikipedia are helpful. Perform some searches to identify recommended databases for your topic. Your librarian will be able to determine access for these resources.\n  Wikipedia: List of academic databases and search engines  It will be useful, if your goal is a thorough survey of the literature, to search more than one database.

Literature databases index citations provided by publishers. Some databases only index journal articles (such as PubMed) while other databases index additional items such as conference proceedings, dissertations, and book chapters.\nDatabase publishers assign each part of a citation to a different field in the database. For example, all authors listed for an articles are assigned to the \u0026ldquo;Author\u0026rdquo; field, all words in an abstract are assigned to the \u0026ldquo;Abstract\u0026rdquo; field, etc. Many databases also add controlled vocabulary terms to describe the major concepts presented in an article which are then tagged as such. Any search terms you use are only searched across the citation information in a database, not the full text of the article.\nSearching using specific fields of a citation in literature databases increases the precision of your search by dictating which part of the citation a specific keyword or phrase must appear. This is useful if you want to find articles on a specific topic that were written by a particular author or originated from a specific institution or are published in a specific journal.\nA way to search for terms in a specific field of a citation is to add a \u0026ldquo;Field Tag\u0026rdquo; to your search terms. Most databases allow you to qualify search terms using a code called a \u0026ldquo;Field Tag\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;Field Descriptor\u0026rdquo; to force the database to only search for that term in a specific field.\nUse Database Filters Many databases allow you to apply filters to limit to your search. For example, you can apply a language filter to limit your search results to articles written in a specific language. You should be extremely careful about how you apply these filters.\nIn most databases, these filters will appear on the left side after you run a search. The most commonly used filters include article or publication type, and publication dates.\nAvoid applying filters that will unnecessarily exclude articles you may want to see. These include filters such as species, ages, text availability, and subject discipline. When you apply these filters, you are using controlled vocabulary or database indexing to exclude articles. This is not always a reliable method of excluding articles, and in these cases you may wish to work with your informationist to discuss the best approach.\nForward and Backward Citation Searching If you find an article that is very relevant, search the reference list to identify other literature that may be pertinent to your research. Conversely, some databases will show you which articles have cited that article.\nSimilar Articles in PubMed In PubMed, there is a feature called \u0026ldquo;Similar Articles.\u0026rdquo; Click on this option to find other articles that are indexed in a similar way to the one you chose. You can find it on the right-hand menu inside the article record, and at the bottom of the article page.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8bb63f2ece139efe1ba225d8497abaa4","permalink":"https://carrieprice78.github.io/guides/expert-searching/pro-tips/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/guides/expert-searching/pro-tips/","section":"guides","summary":"Search by Database Fields Use database fields to search with specific parts of a citation.

The JHNEBP Model\u0026rsquo;s Appendix A - PET Management Guide, supplies you with a checklist to ensure that you have thought through all the steps and have a winning team in place prior to the start. PET stands for Practice Question, Evidence, Translation.\nWhen framing the EBP question, consider ideas such as:\n What is the problem, and why is it important to fix it? What is the current practice? What kinds of evidence or study types will help answer the question?  Is your question a background question or a foreground question?\nBackground Questions - These are usually broad and used in the beginning. Background questions can be refined and adjusted as continue to develop the search. Background questions frequently assist in identifying best practices.\nForeground Questions - These types of questions are focused, with specific comparisons of ideas or interventions. Foreground questions can provide specific evidence related to the research question. Background questions can turn into foreground questions as the review progresses.\nThis process can be identified in the JHNEBP Model, Appendix B - Question Development Tool PICO. After you\u0026rsquo;ve completed Appendix A and Appendix B, complete Appendix C - Stakeholder Analysis Tool. This form is used to identify key stakeholders that can support decision-making, serve as subject matter experts, or implement change.\nSearching for Evidence To find the evidence, you will need to search for it. It will depend on what resources you have access to through your institution, but it is always a best practice to search more than one resource. This is because different resources index different topics and journals.\nUse your question framework or JHNEBP Question Development Tool to determine the major elements of your question. Think about how authors might write about these concepts. There may be many terms to describe just one idea.\nUse the Searching for Evidence with ABCDE or another search approach to conduct a thorough, effective, and comprehensive literature search, and be sure to work with a librarian if you can.\nTranslation Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to critically appraise and take action on the evidence you found through the search. The JHNEBP Model has several tools available to help you grade the evidence and see the process through to the finish line.\n Appendix D - The Evidence Level and Guide outlines three levels of evidence with quality ratings and describes each in a rubric. Appendix E - The Research Evidence Appraisal Tool helps you decide if the evidence is quantitative or qualitative, and how to use that evidence to support your topic. Appendix F - Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;ll find literature that is not primary research. Appendix F walks you through the steps of grading non-research evidence with the Non-Research Evidence Appraisal Tool. Appendix G - You\u0026rsquo;ve read the research and appraised the evidence. Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to put it all together with the Individual Evidence Summary Tool. Appendix H - The Synthesis Process and Recommendations Tool helps you make sense of the strength of the evidence toward a particular recommendation. Appendix I - The Action Planning Tool ensures that you have a team in place to help you champion and implement change. Appendix J - Finally, the Dissemination Tool guides you through ways you can disseminate your findings at conferences, in publications, in social media, and more.  Additional Tools for Critical Appraisal In addition to the evidence levels and grading found in the JHN EBP Model Tools, you may find that other tools can offer additional guidance and understanding:\n  CASP Checklists: This set of eight critical appraisal tools are designed to be used when reading research. These include tools for Systematic Reviews, Randomised Controlled Trials, Cohort Studies, Case Control Studies, Economic Evaluations, Diagnostic Studies, Qualitative studies and Clinical Prediction Rule.  Cochrane Collaboration\u0026rsquo;s Risk of Bias Tool: The Cochrane Risk of Bias is a two-part tool, addressing the seven specific domains discussed in Sections 8.9 to 8.15 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.  Dartmouth Biomedical Libraries: Dartmouth provides a series of worksheets designed to aid you in formulating clinical questions, appraising the evidence, and applying the evidence to practice.  The JADAD Scale for Reporting Randomized Controlled Trials: Jadad, A. R., Moore, R. A., Carroll, D., Jenkinson, C., Reynolds, D. J., Gavaghan, D. J., \u0026amp; McQuay, H. J. (1996).

GRADE Working Group: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (short GRADE) working group began in the year 2000 as an informal collaboration of people with an interest in addressing the shortcomings of grading systems in health care. The working group has developed a common, sensible and transparent approach to grading quality (or certainty) of evidence and strength of recommendations.  JAMA Series on Step-by-Step Critical Appraisal: Links to the \u0026lsquo;User\u0026rsquo;s Guides to the Medical Literature\u0026rsquo; series of articles designed to promote incorporation of evidence into practice.  Joanna Briggs Critical Appraisal Tools: JBI\u0026rsquo;s critical appraisal tools assist in assessing the trustworthiness, relevance, and results of published papers.  Newcastle-Ottawa Scale: The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) is an ongoing collaboration between the Universities of Newcastle, Australia and Ottawa, Canada. It was developed to assess the quality of nonrandomised studies with its design, content and ease of use directed to the task of incorporating the quality assessments in the interpretation of meta-analytic results.  OHAT Risk of Bias Rating Tool: The OHAT Risk of Bias Rating Tool can be used for human and animal studies.  Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence: The CEBM Levels of Evidence framework sets out one approach to systematizing this grading process for different question types.  SYRCLE\u0026rsquo;s Risk of Bias Tool: This tool is based on the Cochrane RoB tool and has been adjusted for aspects of bias that play a specific role in animal intervention studies.  U.S. Preventive Services Task Force: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) assigns one of five letter grades (A, B, C, D, or I). The USPSTF changed its grade definitions based on a change in methods in May 2007 and again in July 2012, when it updated the definition of and suggestions for practice for the grade C recommendation.

SHERPA/RoMEO will guide you through your rights to archive various versions of your research.\nResearchers often publish in journals that may ask for complete transfer of the author’s copyright to the journal. Many researchers might not know they have more rights than they think: as the author of a work you are the copyright holder unless and until you transfer the copyright to someone else in a signed agreement.\n Assigning your rights matters. Normally, the copyright holder possesses the exclusive rights of reproduction, distribution, public performance, public display, and modification of the original work. An author who has transferred copyright without retaining these rights must ask permission unless the use is one of the statutory exemptions in copyright law. The copyright holder controls the work. Decisions concerning use of the work, such as distribution, access, pricing, updates, and any use restrictions belong to the copyright holder. Authors who have transferred their copyright without retaining any rights may not be able to place the work on course websites, copy it for students or colleagues, deposit the work in a public online archive, or reuse portions in a subsequent work. That’s why it is important to retain the rights you need. Transferring copyright doesn’t have to be all or nothing. The law allows you to transfer copyright while holding back rights for yourself and others. This is the compromise that the SPARC Author Addendum helps you to achieve.

Researchers are encouraged to use traditional data points such as citation counts, along with other types of data points such as usage, mentions, and Altmetrics to quantify both the \u0026ldquo;scholarly visibility\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;social visibility\u0026rdquo; of an article. These different types of data points are visualized (right), and they are also discussed below.

Design","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Journal Metrics There are a variety of metrics that attempt to measure the individual journal performance. Journal metrics, such as the Journal Impact Factor by Clarivate Analytics, allow for ranking within a discipline. Authors may also use journal metrics to identify journals in which to publish. Two of the main sources for journal metrics are the Journal Citation Reports (Clarivate Analytics) and CiteScore (Scopus).\nSome caveats about journal metrics:\n Metrics may be easily skewed due factors such as the proportion of review articles a journal publishes (review articles tend to have a higher citation rate) and lack of data about potentially highly cited letters and editorials, and variables in citation practices across disciplines. The Journal Impact Factor was developed as a decision-aid to be used by the publishers of the Institute of Scientific Investigation (now part of Clarivate Analytics) to determine which journals to index and to help librarians with journal subscription purchase choices. It was not meant to be an indicator of research impact. Metrics should not be used as an indicator of an individual article or author\u0026rsquo;s influence.  Selection of Indicators Included in the Journal Citation Report Journal Impact Factor The Journal Impact Factor is defined as all citations to the journal in the current JCR year to items published in the previous two years, divided by the total number of scholarly items (these comprise articles, reviews, and proceedings papers) published in the journal in the previous two years. Though not a strict mathematical average, the Journal Impact Factor provides a functional approximation of the mean citation rate per citable item.\nImmediacy Index The Immediacy Index is the average number of times an article is cited in the year it is published. The Immediacy Index is calculated by dividing the number of times an article is cited in the year it is published.\nBecause it is a per-article average, the Immediacy Index tends to discount the advantage of large journals over small ones. However, frequently issued journals may have an advantage because an article published early in the year has a better chance of being cited than one published later in the year. Many publications that publish infrequently or late in the year have low Immediacy Indexes.\nAverage JIF Percentile The Average Journal Impact Factor Percentile is based on the Journal Impact Factor Percentile (JIF Percentile). The JIF Percentile simply translates a journal’s category rank into a percentile. For example, a journal that is ranked 19 out of 291 Biochemistry \u0026amp; Molecular Biology journals would receive a JIF Percentile score of 94. JIF Percentiles are scaled from 1 to 100 (higher values indicate higher Impact Factor in relation to other journals in the Category). The metric allows you to assess the journal\u0026rsquo;s standing in its own subject field.\nBy factoring in a journal\u0026rsquo;s impact factor within its specific subject field, as well as controlling for the size of the field, the JIF Percentile is normalized and so allows comparison between journals in different subject areas. For example, assessing the impact of a medical journal against an engineering journal in a deeper way than simply comparing their respective Journal Impact Factors.\nEigenfactor The Eigenfactor Score attempts to provide a metric that measures the total influence of a scientific journal. Journals are rated according to the number of incoming citations, with citations from highly cited journals weighted to make a larger contribution to the Eigenfactor. The Eigenfactor score is intended to measure the importance of a journal to the scientific community, by considering the origin of the incoming citations, and is thought to reflect how frequently an average researcher will be redirected back to a journal by following the citations in the articles they find interesting. Typically, journals with a higher JIF have corresponding larger Eigenfactor scores. See the Eigenfactor Project for more information.\nJournal Metrics Found in Scopus CiteScore The CiteScore is based on the average citations received per document. CiteScore is the number of citations received by a journal in one year to documents published in the three previous years, divided by the number of documents indexed in Scopus published in those same three years. CiteScore’s numerator and denominator both include all document types. This not only includes articles and reviews but also letters, notes, editorials, conference papers and other types indexed by Scopus. Therefore, the numerator and the denominator used in the CiteScore calculation are consistent. This approach gives a more complete picture of citation impact and makes manipulation of the calculation more difficult. Articles-in-press are indexed in Scopus for some publishers, but are not included in the CiteScore calculation.\nScimago Journal Rank (SJR) This metric is a field-normalized metric that is an alternative to the Journal Impact Factor. It uses Scopus citation data to calculate the weighted prestige of a journal based on the number of citations received by a journal and the prestige of the journals where the citations originate. With SJR, the subject field, quality and reputation of the journal has a direct effect on the value of a citation. Its method of calculation attempts to normalize for differences in citation behavior between subject fields.\nSource Normalized Impact per Paper(SNIP) SNIP is a field-normalized metric that measures a source’s contextual citation impact by weighting citations based on the total number of citations in a subject field. It helps you make a direct comparison of sources in different subject fields.\nSNIP takes into account characteristics of the source\u0026rsquo;s subject field, which is the set of documents citing that source. SNIP especially considers:\n The frequency at which authors cite other papers in their reference lists The speed at which citation impact matures The extent to which the database used in the assessment covers the field’s literature  SNIP is the ratio of a source\u0026rsquo;s average citation count per paper and the citation potential of its subject field.\nThe citation potential of a source\u0026rsquo;s subject field is the average number of references per document citing that source. It represents the likelihood of being cited for documents in a particular field. A source in a field with a high citation potential tends to have a high impact per paper.\nCitation potential is important because it accounts for the fact that typical citation counts vary widely between research disciplines. For example, they tend to be higher in life sciences than in mathematics or social sciences. If papers in one subject field contain an average of 40 cited references while those in another contain an average of 10, then the former field has a citation potential that is 4 times higher than that of the latter.\nCitation potential also varies between subject fields within a discipline. For instance, basic journals tend to show higher citation potentials than applied or clinical journals, and journals covering emerging topics tend to have higher citation potentials than periodicals in well-established areas\nCiteScore Percentile The CiteScore Perentile indicates the relative standing of a journal in its subject field.

They promote the following ten principles to guide research evaluation:\n Quantitative evaluation should support qualitative, expert assessment. Measure performance against the research missions of the institution, group, or researcher. Protect excellence in locally relevant research. Keep data collection and analytical processes open, transparent, and simple. Allow those evaluated to verify data and analysis. Account for variation by field in publication and citation practices. Base assessment of individual researchers on a qualitative judgment of their portfolio. Avoid misplaced concreteness and false precision. Recognize the systemic effects of assessment and indicators. Scrutinize indicators regularly and update them.  Hicks, D., Wouters, P., Waltman, L., de Rijcke, S., \u0026amp; Rafols, I. (2015). Bibliometrics: The Leiden Manifesto for research metrics. Nature News 520(7548), 429–431. https://doi.org/10.1038/520429a\nMetric Tide Report  The Metric Tide Report, published in 2015 commissioned by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (UK), is a report of the independent review of the role of metrics in research assessment and management. Traditional metrics have long been used as indicators for research and researcher impact. Their use can be problematic when taken out of context with uncritical acceptance. Responsible metrics should be considered and understood in the following dimensions:\n Robustness - Is the metric using the best available and accurate data? Humility - Quantitative evaluation can complement, but not replace, expert assessment. Transparency - Is the collection of data and its analysis open to scrutiny? Diversity - Does the metric represent the landscape of research in any given field, and use appropriate indicators to support research and researchers? Reflexivity - Is the use of bibliometric analysis dynamic and open to change?   Metrics evoke a mixed reaction from the research community. A commitment to using data and evidence to inform decisions makes many of us sympathetic, even enthusiastic, about the prospect of granular, real-time analysis of our own activities. If we as a sector can’t take full advantage of the possibilities of big data, then who can?\n Wilsdon, J., et al. (2015).

PubMed is developed and maintained by the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), both at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD. As of July, 2020, PubMed contains over 30 million records. PubMed is a platform that contains MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and additional PubMed records.\nPubMed Cool Tools Clinical Queries Use Clinical Queries to enable pre-made filters applying to different clinical research areas. Results are delineated into clinical studies, systematic reviews, and medical genetics. Enter your search exactly as you would in the PubMed search box.\nFor more information, see:\n Documentation on the Clinical Studies filters Documentation on the Systematic Reviews filters Documentation on the Medical Genetics filters  Journals in NCBI Databases Use Journals in NCBI Databases to limit your search to a specific journal or to find out more information about journals indexed in MEDLINE.\nSingle Citation Matcher Use the Single Citation Matcher to find citations in PubMed. You may enter or omit any field.\nSpecial Queries Searchers at the National Library of Medicine have created search filters for multiple common topics. See and enable them on the PubMed Special Queries page.\nControlled Vocabulary: MeSH or Medical Subject Headings  MeSH Database\n MeSH stands for Medical Subject Headings. It is a controlled vocabulary of terms assigned to records to make them discoverable. These are a standardized set of terms that are used to bring consistency to the searching process. In total, there are approximately 29,000 MeSH terms, and they are updated annually to reflect changes in terminology. Use the MeSH database to identify Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) which will help you to find literature indexed with the MeSH term. Using MeSH terms helps account for variations in language, acronyms, and British vs. American English. MeSH can be searched from the MeSH Database. Terms are arranged hierarchically by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. MeSH terms in PubMed automatically include the more specific MeSH terms in a search. This is called \u0026ldquo;explode.\u0026rdquo; To turn off this automatic explode feature, click on the button next to, \u0026ldquo;Do not include MeSH terms found below this term in the MeSH hierarchy\u0026rdquo; in the MeSH record or type [mesh:noexp] next to the search term, e.g.neoplasms [mesh:noexp]. See next page for additional information on no explode. Use the PubMed Search Builder on the right side of the screen to add your selected MeSH term to the box, and click Search.  Explode, No Explode, and Major Heading  Explode will search with all narrower headings beneath the main heading you have chosen. PubMed will default to explode any MeSH term you search. No Explode will only search for your chosen MeSH term without including any of the narrower headings in the MeSH hierarchy. You can select this option from the MeSH record. Major Heading will narrow your search to only find MeSH terms listed as a major topic of an article. You can select this option from the MeSH record. Major headings are shown in the article record with an asterisk.  Subheadings MeSH terms can be made more specific by the addition of correlated or free-floating subheadings.\n When in the MeSH record, add subheadings by clicking on the boxes next to the desired subheadings. Then click \u0026ldquo;Add to Search Builder.\u0026rdquo; Warning: Adding too many subheadings may lead to missing important articles. MeSH/Subheading Combinations: You can manually add subheadings in the search box by using the format MeSH Term/Subheading, e.g. neoplasms/diet therapy. See abbreviations of MeSH subheadings, which can also be used. (MeSH Subheadings). For a MeSH/Subheading combination, only one subheading at a time may be directly attached to a MeSH term. For example, a search of Hypertension with the subheadings Diagnosis or Drug Therapy will appear as Hypertension/diagnosis [mesh] OR Hypertension/drug therapy[mesh]. As with MeSH terms, PubMed search results, by default, include the more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms for the MeSH term and also includes the more specific terms arranged beneath broader subheadings.  Keywords Automatic Term Mapping  PubMed uses Automatic Term Mapping (ATM) when you enter terms in the search box. Automatic Term Mapping means that the search terms you type into the search box are automatically mapped to MeSH terms. To see Automatic Term Mapping in action, click on the Details arrow in your Advanced \u0026gt; History and Search Details box. Using quotes around a phrase or truncation turns off Automatic Term Mapping. The terms are instead searched exactly as entered, with no mapping applied.  Using Keywords  Keywords can be any words used to describe your idea or concept. Keywords can be single words or phrases. Use quotes around all phrases to ensure that the phrase is searched together. For more ideas, visit the MeSH database and look at the entry terms listed in the MeSH record. Also consider using synonyms, acroynyms, initialisms, variations in spelling, and other closely-related terms used interchangeably to describe the topic.  Keyword Generation Keywords can be generated by:\n browsing entry terms in PubMed\u0026rsquo;s MeSH, and synonyms in Embase\u0026rsquo;s Emtree to add additional keywords to a concept; looking at a few key articles and seeing how the terminology is used; and by doing a few preliminary searches and browsing the results to see how the terminology is used.  Additional Pro Tips Filters You can use filters to narrow your search results by article type, text availability, publication date, species, language, sex, subject, journal category, and age. See more on Filters on PubMed\u0026rsquo;s Help guide.\n On the left side of the results are options to filter your search. You can access additional filters through the link at the bottom of the filters bar. \u0026ldquo;Text availability\u0026rdquo; is for users who are not affiliated with an institution. You do not need to limit by text availability since you have access to the JH Catalog and Interlibrary Loan. Use filters cautiously. Limits other than date or language will limit your search to MeSH-indexed records only. For example, if you would like to limit your results to \u0026ldquo;human studies,\u0026rdquo; use the following search to exclude animal studies instead of using the \u0026ldquo;humans\u0026rdquo; limit from the search results page. Simply add this to the end of your search:   \u0026hellip;NOT (animals[MeSH Terms] NOT humans[MeSH Terms])\n Phrase Searching Surround phrases with double quotes to search as a phrase to use a more specific search with more precision, and not as disparate words, which will result in a more sensitive search with higher recall. See more on Phrase Searching on PubMed\u0026rsquo;s Help guide.\n \u0026ldquo;hospital acquired infection\u0026rdquo; will return the phrase instead of hospital AND acquired AND infection\n Truncation In PubMed you can use a * at the root of a word to find multiple endings. For example:\n arthroplast* will return arthroplasty, arthroplasties, arthroplastic, arthroplastics, etc.\n  mobili* will return mobility, mobilization, mobilisation, mobilize, etc.\n Note: In New PubMed, you can now truncate a phrase inside quotes. \u0026ldquo;catheter infection*\u0026rdquo; will return catheter infections. See more on on Truncation on PubMed\u0026rsquo;s Help guide.\nField Tags or Field Descriptors Use search field tags to specify in which field the database queries for the search term. In PubMed, first type the search term and then the search field tag in brackets. e.g. Cardiology [tiab] searches for cardiology in the title and abstract.\n [All Fields] or [all] – Untagged terms and terms tagged with [all fields] are processed using Automatic Term Mapping. Terms enclosed in double quotes or truncated will be searched in all fields and not processed using automatic term mapping. [Text Words] or [tw] – Includes all words and numbers in the title, abstract, other abstract, MeSH terms, MeSH Subheadings, Publication Types, Substance Names, Personal Name as Subject, Corporate Author, Secondary Source, Comment/Correction Notes, and Other Terms. [Title/Abstract] or [tiab] – Words and numbers included in the title, collection title, abstract, and other abstract of a citation. English language abstracts are taken directly from the published article. If an article does not have a published abstract, NLM does not create one.

Sixty topic areas are covered, including thirty core clinical and pharmacology topics that represent over 70% of Embase content. The database has more of an international focus than PubMed, and also has greater coverage for pharmaceuticals and medical devices.\nNote that this content is for the Embase.com version of the database, not the Ovid version.\nEmbase Cool Tools PV Wizard Search The PV Wizard (PV stands for pharmacovigilance) allows the searcher to create straightforward queries that include trade names, generic names, and synonyms for drugs and pharmaceuticals. Access the PV Wizard from the search toolbar. Enter your desired drug name and follow the prompts for the most comprehensive drug search.\nDrugs Search While this search option is not fully comprehensive, it can help a searcher find literature on adverse events, toxicity, interactions, and specify routes of administration. .\nMedical Device Search The Medical Device search is located in the Embase search toolbar. Enter the medical device name, browse and edit synonyms, and follow the prompts to create a comprehensive medical device search.\nControlled Vocabulary: Emtree  Similar to MeSH in PubMed, Embase has a controlled vocabulary called Emtree. Terms are arranged hierarchically by subject categories with more specific terms arranged beneath broader terms. Terms include chemical names, trade names, device names and laboratory/research codes mapped to generic names for more than 31,000 drugs and chemicals. Emtree entries include more preferred terms and synonyms than MeSH. Emtree terms allow for more comprehensive explosion than MeSH.  For more information about the differences between MeSH and Emtree, browse this useful whitepaper from Elsevier, \u0026ldquo;A Comparison of Emtree and MeSH.\u0026quot;\nExplode, No Explode, and Major Focus  Explode will search with all subject headings below the main heading included and bring up all results listing any of these terms subject heading subheadings combinations. Command to search:/exp No explode retrieves only the term specified and no headings below it. For example: \u0026lsquo;botany\u0026rsquo;/de only finds records indexed with botany, and not ethnobotany, forensic botany, or palynology. Command to search: /de As major focus will only search for your chosen Emtree term as a main term. Main terms are chosen by Emtree indexers to be the primary focus of an individual article. Command to search: /mj  Detailed information about Emtree vocabulary is available at Elsevier\u0026rsquo;s support hub.\nKeywords Automatic Term Mapping Using Keywords  Keywords are any terms you would use in practice, as well as synonyms, variations in spelling, antonyms, initalisms, and acronyms.

Additional Pro Tips Filters  On the left side of the results are options to filter your search by Sources, Drugs, Diseases, Devices, etc. under the header “Results Filters.\u0026rdquo; Click the arrow next to each filter to see the available options. Warning: filters such as species, ages, text availability, and subject discipline may unnecessarily exclude articles you want to see. When you apply these filters, you are using controlled vocabulary or database indexing to exclude articles. This is not always a reliable method of excluding articles.  Proximity Searching  Embase allows for proximity operators to search for terms within a certain number of words from each other. There are two types of proximity searching: NEAR/n and NEXT/n NEAR/n searches for terms within the specified number of words from each other, in either direction. (therapy NEAR/5 sleep) looks for the word therapy within 5 words of sleep. NEXT/n searches for terms within the specified number of words from each other, in the order the words are typed. For example, therapy NEXT/5 sleep would find “therapy for improved sleep,” but it would not find “sleep therapy.  Phrase Searching Surround phrases with single quotes to search as a phrase. This will allow for a more precise search.\nTruncation  In Embase you can use a * at the root of a word to find multiple endings. For example:  arthroplast* will return arthroplasty, arthroplasties, arthroplastic, arthroplastics, etc. mobili* will return mobility, mobilization, mobilisation, mobilize, etc.   You can also use a ? as a wildcard to search for letter variants within a word (e.g. wom?n finds women and woman) In Embase you can use truncation and phrase searching at the same time. e.g. \u0026ldquo;early childhood mobili*\u0026rdquo; You can use truncation and quotation marks at the same time. For example, the search “sleep therap*” will return “sleep therapy” and sleep therapies”  Field Tags or Field Descriptors To locate field limits (such as title, abstract), go to the \u0026ldquo;Advanced Search\u0026rdquo; page and click on the link for “fields” located in small print beneath the search box. Default is \u0026ldquo;all fields,\u0026rdquo; but by entering a search term and then clicking on one of these limits (for example, clicking \u0026ldquo;Abstract :ab\u0026rdquo;) will add it to the search builder.\nThe Embase field tags that most closely resemble [tw] in PubMed are: abstract, title, keyword. For example: \u0026lsquo;vaccine\u0026rsquo;:ti,ab,kw will search the title, abstract, and keywords To search Title/abstract only use “:ab,ti.” For example: \u0026lsquo;vaccine\u0026rsquo;:ab,ti . This tag can also involve multiple search terms. For example: (opioid* OR narcotic*):ti,ab Other commands include:\n \u0026lsquo;term\u0026rsquo;:ti (Title) \u0026lsquo;term\u0026rsquo;:ab (Abstract) \u0026lsquo;Smith A\u0026rsquo;:au (Author) \u0026lsquo;term\u0026rsquo;:ad (Author Address/Affiliation) \u0026lsquo;term\u0026rsquo;:jt (Journal Title)  A comprehensive list of field tags, including those for drugs and devices, can be found at Elsevier\u0026rsquo;s support hub.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"ae2f1a107003eb77ca2c395ee1571d31","permalink":"https://carrieprice78.github.io/guides/expert-searching/embase-tips/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/guides/expert-searching/embase-tips/","section":"guides","summary":"When to Use Embase Embase has over 32 million records, including articles from 7,600 peer-reviewed journal titles.

At its core is the collection of Cochrane Reviews, a database of systematic reviews and meta-analyses which summarizes and interprets the results of medical research, which are often considered high-quality in terms of quality and reporting. The Cochrane Library also contains CENTRAL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.\nCochrane Library Cool Tools In addition to their databases, the Cochrane Library offers:\n Clinical Answers, meant to provide easily digestible, clinically-focused entry points to rigorous research from Cochrane Reviews, to assist in point-of-care evidence-based decision making. Note the topic and recency filters on the left side of the page. Special Collections, highlighting Cochrane Reviews and blog posts on trending topics.  The Cochrane Colloquium offers some free trainings on evidence-based methodologies, as well as free access to two publications outlining systematic review methodological expectations.\n Higgins JPT, Thomas J, Chandler J, Cumpston M, Li T, Page MJ, Welch VA (editors).

Available online at https://community.cochrane.org/mecir-manual.  Controlled Vocabulary: Medical Subject Headings or MeSH  The Cochrane Library relies on Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) from the National Library of Medicine, composed of a controlled vocabulary of biomedical terms used to describe the subjects of a journal article. To access the hierarchical listing of terms, click on the “Medical Terms (MeSH)” tab or use the MeSH icon in the Search Manager. After typing in a term in the MeSH search box, matches to the MeSH thesaurus will be displayed along with structured trees that show the hierarchical relationships among related terms. A summary of search results from different Cochrane databases will also be displayed. Once you have selected you MeSH tree options, you can run it as a search by clicking the “Add to Search Manager” link. It will then be present in the “Search Manager” tab (second from the left).  Hierarchy and Subheadings  MeSH trees displayed in Cochrane allow you to visualize where your MeSH term sits in the hierarchy of terms and shows any branches off of your term. Selecting “Explode all trees,” allows you to search for your term and any terms that branch from it. Selecting “Single MeSH term (unexploded),” allows you to just search for your MeSH term without branches. If your MeSH term is part of multiple trees, you can select the specific trees you want to search by selecting “Explode selected trees.” A second search box gives you the option to \u0026ldquo;Select subheadings / qualifiers.\u0026rdquo; Any MeSH can be made more specific by the addition of subheadings. These appear as a drop down menu similar to what’s described above for the “Enter MeSH term” box.  Keywords Automatic Term Mapping Using Keywords  Keywords are any terms you would use in practice, as well as synonyms, variations in spelling, antonyms, initalisms, and acronyms. Keywords can be single words or phrases. Use quotes around all phrases to ensure that the phrase is searched together. For more ideas, visit the MeSH database and look at the entry terms listed in the MeSH record. Also consider using synonyms, acroynyms, initialisms, variations in spelling, and other closely-related terms used interchangeably to describe the topic.  Keyword Generation Keywords can be generated by:\n browsing entry terms in PubMed\u0026rsquo;s MeSH, and synonyms in Embase\u0026rsquo;s Emtree to add additional keywords to a concept; looking at a few key articles and seeing how the terminology is used; and by doing a few preliminary searches and browsing the results to see how the terminology is used.  Additional Pro Tips Filters The Cochrane Library will display your search in tabs by systematic reviews and clinical trials. You can also click on the filter icon next to your search to limit by year.\nProximity Searching  Cochrane allows for proximity searching through the use of two operators (NEAR or NEXT), along with a number to indicate the proximity of the words . Proximity search using NEAR: Use NEAR/ with a number to indicate proximity of terms either before or after each other. For example, “antidepressant NEAR/10 narcolepsy” looks for the word antidepressant within 10 words of narcolepsy. The default proximity value for the operator when no number is entered is 6. Proximity search using NEXT: Use NEXT to match terms that appear next to each other. E.g. cholera NEXT treat* would return “cholera treatment” Note that the apostrophe within a term is treated as a space. To search for adjacent words in a term such as Down\u0026rsquo;s Syndrome, the best approach is to use NEAR instead of NEXT. The search parameter to use in this case would be: down* NEAR/2 syndrome Hyphenated terms: Hyphens are treated as a space with an associated NEXT operator. The term heart-related will match the same results as heart NEXT related. E.g. evidence-based NEXT medicine  Phrase Searching Surround phrases with single quotes to search as a phrase. This will allow for a more precise search.\nTruncation  In the Cochrane Library, you can use a * at the root of a word to find multiple endings. For example:  arthroplast* will return arthroplasty, arthroplasties, arthroplastic, arthroplastics, etc. mobili* will return mobility, mobilization, mobilisation, mobilize, etc.    Field Tags or Field Descriptors From the Search Manager tab, you can use field tags to specify where the database looks for the search term. In Cochrane, first type the search term and then the field tag preceded by a colon. e.g. \u0026ldquo;Cardiology\u0026rdquo;:ti looks for cardiology in the title\n :ti - Searches the Title field :ab - Searches the Abstract field :kw - Searches the Keyword field :au - Searches the Author field :so - Searches the Source field :pt - Searches the Publication Type field :tb - Searches the Tables field  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"616048ea7718a9a6f7b414278ba90227","permalink":"https://carrieprice78.github.io/guides/expert-searching/cochrane-tips/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/guides/expert-searching/cochrane-tips/","section":"guides","summary":"When to Use the Cochrane Library The Cochrane Library is a collection of databases in medicine and other healthcare specialties provided by the Cochrane Collaboration and other organizations.

You will find that many databases use their own controlled vocabularies (sometimes called index terms, subject headings, or a thesaurus) to enhance the findability of citations. If you have heard of MeSH, this stands for Medical Subject Headings, and is the controlled vocabulary used in PubMed.\nDatabases that use controlled vocabularies employ subject specialists who review individual citations and add the appropriate controlled vocabulary terms to the citation that describe all of the concepts covered in the article. Using controlled vocabulary terms in your search strategy allows you to locate citations no matter what term(s) an author does or does not use, and helps account for spelling variations and acronyms.\nMethods for Finding Controlled Vocabulary Terms  Do a basic keyword search and choose a few citations that are relevant to your research question. Make a note of any keywords used in the article title or citation you may wish to add to your current list of keywords. Examine the full citation information for each article to find the controlled vocabulary terms assigned and write them down. Redo your search using both the controlled vocabulary and keyword terms.  Keywords Keywords are the words used in an article title, abstract, or other text field in a database. Keyword searching, or natural language searching, is how most people search for information and is often sufficient for most people. One drawback of searching with keywords is that the words that you use must match the terms used by an author. To remedy this problem, a complete keyword search strategy will include multiple spellings and synonyms that represent the concept. Keyword searching is also useful when attempting to identify literature that may not have been indexed with controlled vocabulary terms, for any variety of reasons.\nCombining Search Terms Effectively Boolean operators form the basis of mathematical sets and database logic. Using these terms to combine concepts and keywords in your search will assist you in performing a transparent, reproducible, and thorough search. Boolean operators include AND, OR, and NOT. These are generally always capitalized.\n AND - AND is used to link ideas and concepts where you want to see both ideas or concepts in your search results. AND narrows the search.   \u0026ldquo;children\u0026rdquo; AND \u0026ldquo;poverty\u0026rdquo;\n  OR - OR is used between similar keywords, like synonyms, acronyms, and variations in spelling within the same idea or concept. OR broadens the search.   \u0026ldquo;behavior\u0026rdquo; OR \u0026ldquo;behaviour\u0026rdquo;\n  NOT - NOT is used to exclude specific keywords from the search, however, you will want to use NOT with caution because you may end up missing something important. NOT is used to make broad exclusions. In this example, any article that discusses both \u0026ldquo;pediatrics\u0026rdquo; as well as \u0026ldquo;adults\u0026rdquo; will be excluded.   \u0026ldquo;pediatrics\u0026rdquo; NOT \u0026ldquo;adults\u0026rdquo;\n Searching Best Practice: Combine Controlled Vocabulary with Keywords It is good practice to search with both controlled vocabulary and keywords. Here are a few reasons:\n Not every database uses a controlled vocabulary (Scopus and Web of Science are two examples) Each database may have its own controlled vocabulary terms If an article is too new, it may not be indexed with controlled vocabulary yet, and you would only find it with keywords In PubMed, if an article is out of scope of MEDLINE, a component of PubMed, it may not ever be indexed with MeSH (PubMed\u0026rsquo;s controlled vocabulary), and you would only find it with keywords If an article lacks an abstract or additional author-supplied keywords, you may only find it with controlled vocabulary  If you want to be as comprehensive as possible, search with both controlled vocabulary and keywords.\nUse Caution In bibliographic databases, stop words are words that the database has been programmed to ignore in a search string or query. Stop words include of, the, is, at, which,and on. Avoid using stopwords in your searches.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f08d1aed6185852608860ea10d12e3cd","permalink":"https://carrieprice78.github.io/guides/expert-searching/generate-terms/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/guides/expert-searching/generate-terms/","section":"guides","summary":"Controlled Vocabulary Controlled vocabularies are a set of predetermined terms that describe specific concepts.
